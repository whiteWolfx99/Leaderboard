# Leaderboard: hit the API

## Description

In this activity you will continue working on the *Leaderboard list* app, sending and receiving data from/to the Leaderboard API.

### Project requirements

- Read the [Leaderboard API documentation](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3) to learn how to use this API.
- Create a new game with the name of your choice by using the API.
    - Make sure that you saved the ID of your game that will be returned by API.
- Implement the "Refresh" button that will get all scores for a game created by you from the API (receiving data from the API and parsing the JSON).
- Implement the form "Submit" button that will save a score for a game created by you (sending data to the API).
- Use `arrow functions` instead of the `function` keyword.
- Use `async` and `await` JavaScript features to consume the API.
- No styling is required.
